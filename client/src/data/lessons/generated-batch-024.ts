        title: "Cranial Nerve Assessment",
        cellular: { title: "Anatomy and Function of the Cranial Nerves", content: "The twelve cranial nerves emerge directly from the brain (most from the brainstem) and control sensory, motor, and autonomic functions of the head, face, neck, and visceral organs. Understanding cranial nerve anatomy is essential for nurses because changes in cranial nerve function can indicate neurological deterioration, stroke, increased intracranial pressure, or brainstem compression requiring immediate intervention.\n\nThe cranial nerves are numbered I through XII based on their position from anterior to posterior on the brainstem. A useful mnemonic for remembering their names is: Oh Oh Oh To Touch And Feel Very Good Velvet, Ah Heaven (Olfactory, Optic, Oculomotor, Trochlear, Trigeminal, Abducens, Facial, Vestibulocochlear, Glossopharyngeal, Vagus, Accessory, Hypoglossal). Their functions can be remembered with: Some Say Marry Money But My Brother Says Big Brains Matter More (Sensory, Sensory, Motor, Motor, Both, Motor, Both, Sensory, Both, Both, Motor, Motor).\n\nCN I (Olfactory): Pure sensory nerve carrying smell sensation from the nasal epithelium to the olfactory bulb. Tested by having the patient identify familiar scents (coffee, vanilla) with eyes closed, one nostril at a time. Loss of smell (anosmia) can follow head trauma, nasal obstruction, or frontal lobe lesions.\n\nCN II (Optic): Pure sensory nerve carrying visual information from the retina to the occipital cortex. Tested by visual acuity (Snellen chart), visual field testing (confrontation), and fundoscopic examination. Papilledema (swelling of the optic disc) seen on fundoscopy indicates increased intracranial pressure.\n\nCN III (Oculomotor), CN IV (Trochlear), CN VI (Abducens): These three nerves work together to control eye movements and pupil function. CN III controls most eye movements (up, down, medial), eyelid elevation, pupil constriction, and lens accommodation. CN IV controls downward and inward eye movement. CN VI controls lateral (outward) eye movement. Tested together by having the patient follow a finger through six cardinal positions of gaze. A fixed, dilated pupil on one side (blown pupil) indicates CN III compression, often from uncal herniation - this is a neurological emergency.\n\nCN V (Trigeminal): Mixed nerve providing facial sensation (three branches: ophthalmic V1, maxillary V2, mandibular V3) and motor function to muscles of mastication. Tested by light touch to three facial areas and clenching teeth. Important for the corneal reflex (afferent limb).\n\nCN VII (Facial): Mixed nerve controlling facial expression muscles, taste to the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, and some salivary and lacrimal gland secretion. Tested by asking patient to raise eyebrows, close eyes tightly, smile, and puff cheeks. In Bell palsy (peripheral CN VII lesion), the entire half of the face is paralyzed. In stroke (central lesion), only the lower face is affected because the upper face receives bilateral cortical innervation.\n\nCN VIII (Vestibulocochlear): Pure sensory nerve for hearing and balance. Tested by whisper test, Weber test, and Rinne test. Sudden hearing loss may indicate acoustic neuroma or stroke.\n\nCN IX (Glossopharyngeal) and CN X (Vagus): Often assessed together. CN IX provides sensation to the posterior pharynx and taste to the posterior tongue. CN X controls pharyngeal and laryngeal muscles (swallowing, voice), and parasympathetic innervation to thoracic and abdominal organs (heart rate, digestion). Tested by gag reflex, saying 'ah' (uvula should rise midline), and assessing voice quality. Absent gag reflex or hoarse voice suggests brainstem compromise. CN X dysfunction causes aspiration risk.\n\nCN XI (Accessory): Pure motor nerve controlling the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. Tested by having the patient shrug shoulders and turn head against resistance.\n\nCN XII (Hypoglossal): Pure motor nerve controlling tongue movement. Tested by asking the patient to protrude the tongue (deviates toward the side of the lesion) and move it side to side. Important for speech and swallowing." },

        correct: 1,
        rationale: "A unilateral fixed, dilated pupil (blown pupil) is a neurological emergency that may indicate CN III compression from uncal herniation caused by rising intracranial pressure. This requires immediate reporting, likely CT scan, and possible neurosurgical intervention."

        rationale: "Cranial nerves IX (glossopharyngeal) and X (vagus) control the gag reflex and swallowing. After a stroke, these functions may be impaired, placing the patient at risk for aspiration. The gag reflex and swallowing assessment should be performed before any oral intake."

A stroke would spare the forehead because it receives bilateral cortical innervation, so only the lower face would be affected with a central lesion."
